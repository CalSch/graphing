# Graphing
This is an app that graphs equations, similar to [Desmos](https://desmos.com/calculator) but worse.
It is written in C++ and is intended for a 320x240 screen (my Raspberry Pi screen dimensions), but it can be changed.  
  
This uses the [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and [tinyexpr++](https://github.com/Blake-Madden/tinyexpr-plusplus) libraries.

# Features
- Multiple equations with random colors
- Functions like abs, log, sin, cos, tan, atan, etc.
- Moveable and zoomable window
- Custom variables

# Todo
- Tracing (show y value at a specific x value)
- ~Variable definition~
- Polar coordinates
- A table
- ~Saving and loading~
- Changing equation colors
- Make the code less horrible
